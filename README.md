- 👋 Hi, I’m Amos.
- -  I’m interested in not just learning how to use technology, but what makes it "tick."
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a few coding projects to get acclimated to what real world scenarios in coding look like.
- 📫 I can be reached via e-mail at amos.u.wilsonii@gmail.com.
-   I look forward to creating and building a strong network of dedicated professional coders from whom I can draw from and share with within this industry to become an integral part of making this newest wave of technology successful!
